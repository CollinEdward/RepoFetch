# GitHub Tool Automation

This repository contains a Python script for automating the setup and installation of various cybersecurity tools from GitHub repositories. The script clones specified repositories and checks for setup scripts and `requirements.txt` files to facilitate the setup process.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- You need to have Git installed on your system.
- Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-tool-automation.git
cd github-tool-automation
```

The script will clone the specified GitHub repositories into a directory named "tools" and, if available, execute setup scripts or install dependencies from `requirements.txt` files.

## Customize the Script

You can customize the `setup_tools.py` script by modifying the `repositories` list to include or exclude specific GitHub repositories. Additionally, you can enhance the script to handle additional setup and installation tasks specific to your requirements.
